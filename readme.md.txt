Problem Statement
In this Problem, you have to write an application in Python 3.7 that maps Companies and
Directors as per the below guidelines.
Assume that you are working for corporate fraud investigation agency and you want to analyse frauds
conducted through money transfer between companies. Agency has identified an association pattern
between directors and companies and based on that they want to develop a software application.
Model the following problem as a graph-based problem. Clearly state how the vertices and
edges can be modelled such that this graph can be used to answer the following queries
efficiently.
1. List of unique companies and directors the agency has stored in the system.
2. List of companies associated with a director
3. List of directors associated with a company
4. Validate if two companies have a common director
5. Find if two companies can be connected through a network of directors and companies (you
can assume that a director can be associated with max two companies)
6. If you start with a company and reach another company traversing through your graph, then
they are connected.
7. Perform an analysis for the features above and give the running time in terms of input size: n.
The basic structure of the graph will be:
class CorporateNetwork:
DirectorCompany=[] # list containing companies and directors
Edges=[[],[]] # matrix of edges/ associations
Operations:
1. def readCompanyDirfile (self, inputfile): This function reads the input file inputPS17.txt
containing the name of the companies and associated directors in one line. The name of the
Director and Companies should be separated by a slash.
ABCD Corp / James Smith / Maria Garcia
The function should create relevant vertices for the Directors and Companies and relevant
edges to indicate the connection of a Company and its Directors. Ensure that the vertices are
unique and there are no duplicates.
2. def displayAll(self): This function displays the count of unique Directors and Companies
entered through the input file. It should also list out the unique Directors and Companies. The
output of this function should be stored in outputPS17.txt file. The output format should be
as mentioned below.
--------Function displayAll--------
Total no. of Companies: 8
Total no. of Directors: 20
List of Companies:
ABCD Corp
HaHaHa Laughing Corp
List of Directors:
…….
3. def displayCompanies(self, Director): This function displays all the Companies a particular
Director is associated with. The function reads the input Company name from the file
promptsPS17.txt where the search id is mentioned with the tag as shown below.
findCompany: James Smith
findCompany: Maria Garcia
The output of this function should be appended into outputPS17.txt file. If a Company is not
found, an appropriate message should be output to the file. The output format should be as
mentioned below.
--------Function displayCompanies --------
Director name: James Smith
List of Companies:
ABCD Corp
(if Company is not found display appropriate message)
-----------------------------------------
Note: This is only an indicative output and not the actual output of the program.
4. def displayDirectors(self, Company): This function displays all the Directors associated
with a Company. The function reads the input Company name from the file promptsPS17.txt
where the search id is mentioned with the tag as shown below.
listDirectors: ABCD Corp
listDirectors: HaHaHa Laughing Corp
The output of this function should be appended into output PS17.txt file. If a Director is not
found, an appropriate message should be output to the file. The output format should be as
mentioned below.
--------Function displayDirectors --------
Company name: ABCD Corp
List of Directors:
James Smith
Maria Garcia
(if Director is not found, display appropriate message)
-----------------------------------------
5. def findCommonDirector(self, CompanyA, CompanyB): Check if two Companies A and B
are related to each other through a common Director. The function reads the input Company
names from the file promptsPS17.txt where the search id is mentioned with the tag as shown
below.
CommonDirector: Company A: Company B
Identify the Director that links Company A and Company B. The output of this function should
be appended into output PS17.txt file. If a relation is not found, an appropriate message
should be output to the file. The output format should be as mentioned below.
--------Function findDirectorConnect --------
Company A: ABCD Corp
Company B: HaHaHa Laughing Corp
Related: Yes, James Smith
(if no, display appropriate message)
-----------------------------------------
6. def findRelatedCompany(self, CompanyA, CompanyB): Check if two Companies A and B
are connected to each other through a path on the graph. The function reads the input 
Company names from the file promptsPS17.txt where the search id is mentioned with the
tag as shown below.
RelatedCompany: Company A: Company B
The output of this function should be appended into outputPS17.txt file. If a relation is not
found, an appropriate message should be output to the file. The output format should be as
mentioned below.
--------Function findRelatedCompany --------
Company A: ABCD Corp
Company B: HaHaHa Laughing Corp
Related: Yes
7. Add other functions that are required to perform the above minimum requirement
Sample Input file
The input file inputPS17.txt contains names of the Directors and its associated Companies in one
line. The name of the Director and Companies should be separated by a slash (/).

3. Instructions
1. It is compulsory to make use of the data structure(s) / algorithms mentioned in the problem
statement.
2. Ensure that all data structure insert and delete operations throw appropriate messages when
their capacity is empty or full. Also ensure basic error handling is implemented.
3. For the purposes of testing, you may implement some functions to print the data structures or
other test data. But all such functions must be commented before submission.
4. Make sure that your read, understand, and follow all the instructions
5. Ensure that the input, prompt and output file guidelines are adhered to. Deviations from the
mentioned formats will not be entertained.
6. The input, prompt and output samples shown here are only a representation of the syntax to
be used. Actual files used to evaluate the submissions will be different. Hence, do not hard
code any values into the code.
7. Run time analysis is to be provided in asymptotic notations and not timestamp based runtimes
in sec or milliseconds.
Instructions for use of Python:
1. Implement the above problem statement using Python 3.7.
2. Use only native data types like lists and tuples in Python, do not use dictionaries provided in
Python. Use of external libraries like graph, numpy, pandas library etc. is not allowed. The
purpose of the assignment is for you to learn how these data structures are constructed and
how they work internally.
3. Create a single *.py file for code. Do not fragment your code into multiple files.
4. Do not submit a Jupyter Notebook (no *.ipynb). These submissions will not be evaluated.
5. Read the input file and create the output file in the root folder itself along with your .py file. Do
not create separate folders for input and output files.
4. Deadline
1. The strict deadline for submission of the assignment is 27th Dec, 2020.
2. The deadline has been set considering extra days from the regular duration in order to
accommodate any challenges you might face. No further extensions will be entertained.
3. Late submissions will not be evaluated.
5. How to submit
1. This is a group assignment.
2. Each group has to make one submission (only one, no resubmission) of solutions.
3. Each group should zip all the deliverables in one zip file and name the zipped file as mentioned
above.
4. Assignments should be submitted via Canvas > Assignment section. Assignment submitted
via other means like email etc. will not be graded.
6. Evaluation
1. The assignment carries 12 Marks.
2. Grading will depend on
a. Fully executable code with all functionality working as expected
b. Well-structured and commented code
c. Accuracy of the run time analysis and design document.
3. Every bug in the functionality will have negative marking.
4. Marks will be deducted if your program fails to read the input file used for evaluation due to
change / deviation from the required syntax.
5. Use of only native data types and avoiding libraries like numpy, graph and pandas will get
additional marks.
6. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. If two different groups submit the same code, both teams will
get zero marks.
7. Source code files which contain compilation errors will get at most 25% of the value of that
question.
